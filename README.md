# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Projects
Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## P1: Investigate a Dataset
In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## P2: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I document my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

## P3: Create Tableau Story
I create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. My work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
